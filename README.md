## App Info
This YouTube web App uses ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, and API Integration. I have tried making the exact look-a-like YouTube clone.
I have used the free YouTube API available on RapidAPI. This API allows only 100 API calls per month, hence, a direct link to a YouTube clone is not provided anywhere. 
The site has been deployed using the Netlify service. The link is mentioned here. If the link doesn't load any data, please leave a comment, which means the API limit is exceeded.
